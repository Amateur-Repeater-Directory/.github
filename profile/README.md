# Amateur Repeater Directory
Free, Verified, Community-Maintained repeater information

The Amateur Repeater Directory (ARD) is a free, open-source, community-built alternative to closed repeater lists.  
Using real elevation and line-of-sight data, ARD reveals repeaters you can actually reach — sometimes far beyond your search range.  

Our live map shows not just where repeaters are, but where conversations are happening right now.  
ARD is lightweight, fast, and works on any device, with open data and open tools that anyone can use or improve.
